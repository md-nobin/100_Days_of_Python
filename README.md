# 100_Days_of_Python
I am committed to completing the 100 days of Python challenge. I hereby pledge to work for at least an hour on Python programming for 100 days. I will keep myself on track, even though some days I might feel tired or frustrated. I will overcome difficulties and achieve my goal. I will become a Python developer. I believe in myself.
