I build a project called _(tip calculator)_
About my project: I build a tip calculator. It says, welcome to the tip calculator.
It asks you for the total bill that you need to pay, then it asks you how many people do you want to
split the bill between? and then what percentage tip would you like to give?. Now it's going to calculate
what each person should pay.
