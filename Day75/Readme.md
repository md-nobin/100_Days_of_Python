## Objective

* Make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g. from daily data to monthly data).

* Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, line-styles, markers, colours, and the chart's resolution.

* Using grids to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.

* Finding the number of missing and NaN values and locate NaN values in a DataFrame.

* Work with Locators to better style the time axis on a chart.

* Review the concepts learned in the previous three days and apply them to new datasets.
