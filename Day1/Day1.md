## Day 1 

Today I learn about

* 1.Variables in Python
* 2.String Manipulation
* 3.Input and Print Functions
* 4.Variable Naming Rules

I build a project called (Band_Name_Generator)
About my project: it's a band name generator. And it asks you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet.
And then it combines those together and gives you the name of your band.

Print
Prints a string into the console.
print("Hello World")

Input
Prints a string into the console,
and asks the user for a string input.
input("What's your name")

Comments
Adding a # symbol in font of text
The computer will ignore comments.
This is a comment
#print("This is code")

Variables
A variable give a name to a piece of data.
Like a box with a label, it tells what's
inside the box.
my_name = "Nobin"
my_age = 12
