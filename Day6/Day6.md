Today I learn about

* Code Blocks
* Indentation
* Functions
* While Loops


Creating Functions
> def my_function():

This is the basic syntax for a function in
Python.
It allows us to give a set of
instructions a name, so we can trigger it
multiple times without having to re-write
or copy-paste it. The contents of the function
must be indented to signal that it's inside.


Calling Functions
We can activate the function by calling it.
This is simply done by writing the name of
the function followed by a set of round
brackets. This allows us to determine
when to trigger the function and how
many times.

> my_function()

While Loop
This is a loop that will keep repeating itself
until the while condition becomes false.

> n = 1

> while n < 100:

> n += 1
