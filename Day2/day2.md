Today I learn about

* Mathematical Operations in Python
* DataTypes
* Converting types
* f-strings

I build a project called _(tip calculator)_
About my project: I build a tip calculator. It says, welcome to the tip calculator.
It asks you for the total bill that you need to pay, then it asks you how many people do you want to
split the bill between? and then what percentage tip would you like to give?. Now it's going to calculate
what each person should pay.

The += Operator
This is a convient way of saying: take the
previous value and add to it.
my_age = 12
my_age += 4
#my_age is now 16

Data types
Integers
Integers are whole numbers.
my_number = 354

Floating Point Numbers
Floats are numbers with decimal places. the result will always be, add a
floating point.
my_gpa = 3.14

Strings
A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.
my_Name = "Nobin"

String Concatenation
We can add strings to string to create
a new string. This is called concatenation.
It results in a new string.
"Hello" + "Nobin"
becomes "HelloAngela"

F-Strings
We can insert a variable into a string
using f-strings.
The syntax is insert the variable
in-between a set of curly braces {}.
days = 365
print(f"There are {days} in a year")
